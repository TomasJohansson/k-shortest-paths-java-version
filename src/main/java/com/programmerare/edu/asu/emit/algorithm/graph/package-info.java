/**
 * Regarding the package name "com.programmerare.edu.asu.emit.algorithm.graph":
 * The prefix "com.programmerare" is used for the package name which otherwise 
 * would have been just "edu.asu.emit.algorithm.graph".
 * 
 * The latter is the package name with the original work found here:
 * https://github.com/yan-qi/k-shortest-paths-java-version/tree/master/src/main/java/edu/asu/emit/algorithm/graph
 * 
 * In that package there is a Graph class which is used as a base class for a new class in this fork.
 * 
 * In terms of java code, the relation looks like this:
 * 		public class com.programmerare.edu.asu.emit.algorithm.graph.GraphPossibleToCreateProgrammatically 
 * 			extends edu.asu.emit.algorithm.graph.Graph
